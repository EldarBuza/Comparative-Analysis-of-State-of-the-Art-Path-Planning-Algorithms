# Comparative Analysis of State-of-the-Art Path Planning Algorithms
This repository presents the implementation part of my Bachelor's thesis on the topic "Comparative Analysis of State-of-the-Art Path Planning Algorithms".

## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 (Community or any other IDE Edition)
- vcpkg (specifically for Windows)
- CMake (can be downloaded as an extension inside Visual Studio 2022 or through vcpkg via `vcpkg install cmake`)
- Git

## Running the project
- `git clone` the repository
- Open Visual Studio and load the CMake project
- Inside the Visual Studio terminal run `mkdir build`
- Afterwards, run `cd build`
- Run `cmake ..` - This will create the solution file for Visual Studio
- Run the .exe file inside Visual Studio (it should be automatically detected by Visual Studio)
